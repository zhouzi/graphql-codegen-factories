# Installation

Install the via npm:

```sh
npm install --save-dev graphql-codegen-factories
```

Or yarn:

```
yarn add --dev graphql-codegen-factories
```

Then add it to your `codegen.yml`, in the list of plugins:

```yml
overwrite: true
schema: ./schema.graphql
generates:
  ./types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      # highlight-start
      - graphql-codegen-factories/schema
      # highlight-end
```

The plugin relies on the types generated by [`@graphql-codegen/typescript`](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typescript), that's why it's also listed in the example above.

If you want to generate factories for operations, you will need to add it as follows:

```yml
overwrite: true
schema: ./schema.graphql
# highlight-start
documents: ./**/*.graphql
# highlight-end
generates:
  ./types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - graphql-codegen-factories/schema
  # highlight-start
  ./operations.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript-operations
      - graphql-codegen-factories/operations
  # highlight-end
```

In this case you will need to use a plugin that generates the types for operations such as [@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typescript-operations), used in the example above. The plugin is also compatible with [@graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/near-operation-file-preset).
