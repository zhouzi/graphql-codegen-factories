# Getting Started

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="yarn" value="yarn">

```
yarn add --dev graphql-codegen-factories
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm" value="npm">

```sh
npm install --save-dev graphql-codegen-factories
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The package is split into two plugins:

- `graphql-codegen-factories/schema`: generates factories based on a GraphQL schema.
- `graphql-codegen-factories/operations`: generates factories based on GraphQL operations. The schema plugin is required for the operations plugin to work as it leverages the factories generated by the former.

## Schema

The factories generated by this plugin use the types generated by [@graphql-codegen/typescript](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typescript) so make sure it is installed.
The next step is to add `graphql-codegen-factories/schema` to the list of plugins in your `codegen.yml` configuration file.

```yml title="codegen.yml"
overwrite: true
schema: ./schema.graphql
documents: ./**/*.graphql
generates:
  ./types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      # highlight-start
      - graphql-codegen-factories/schema
      # highlight-end
```

To access the full list of options, see the documentation for the [configuration](./configuration/schema.mdx).

## Operations

The factories generated by this plugin use the types generated by [@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typescript-operations) so make sure it is installed.
It also leverages the factories generated by the schema plugin which must be installed as described above.
The next step is to add `graphql-codegen-factories/operations` to the list of plugins in your `codegen.yml` configuration file along with the path to the file with the factories.

```yml title="codegen.yml"
overwrite: true
schema: ./schema.graphql
documents: ./**/*.graphql
generates:
  ./types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - graphql-codegen-factories/schema
      - typescript-operations
      # highlight-start
      - graphql-codegen-factories/operations
      # highlight-end
```

To access the full list of options, see the documentation for the [configuration](./configuration/operations.mdx).
