# Introduction

`graphql-codegen-factories` is a plugin for [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) that generates factories based on a GraphQL schema and operations.
Those factories can then be used to create objects that match the schema, for example to mock data in tests or to seed a database.

<div className="codeBlocks">

```graphql title="schema.graphql"
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
}

type Query {
  loggedInUser: User!
}
```

```typescript title="factories.ts"
export function createUserMock(props: Partial<User>): User {
  return {
    id: "",
    username: "",
    ...props,
  };
}
```

</div>
