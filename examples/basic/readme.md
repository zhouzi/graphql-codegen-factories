# Basic Example

This example showcases the basic usage of [`graphql-codegen-factories`](https://github.com/zhouzi/graphql-codegen-factories), a [graphql-code-generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) plugin ([read more](https://github.com/zhouzi/graphql-codegen-factories#readme)).

It generates factories in `generated/types.ts` based on the schema in `src/schema.graphql`.
